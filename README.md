## 🧐 The Vibe
Most expense trackers are boring spreadsheets that feel like homework. **WalletRIP** is your wallet's conscience. It doesn't just track your spending; it judges it.

It’s built for speed, privacy, and brutal honesty.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 The AI Brain
Forget forms. Just type naturally: *"Spent 50 on pizza"* or *"Uber to work 25"*. The integrated AI parses the context, categorizes it, and logs it instantly. No local processing—everything happens in the cloud for maximum efficiency.

### ⚖️ The Sarcastic Judge
If you spend money on "Needs" (Rent, Groceries), it stays quiet. If you blow cash on "Wants" (Lego, overpriced coffee), it delivers a sarcastic reality check. It keeps you humble.

### 👻 Ghost Protocol Auth
Privacy is paramount.
- **No Email Required**: We don't want your spam address.
- **No Phone Numbers**: We don't want to text you.
- **Callsign Access**: Just pick a unique **Callsign** (username) and a **Secret Code**.
- **Universal Sync**: Access your data securely from any device—Mobile, Tablet, or Desktop.

### 🛡️ Military-Grade Security
Built on **Supabase** with strict **Row Level Security (RLS)**. Your financial data is isolated, encrypted, and visible *only* to you.

## 👥 How to Join
This is a private instance (I'm broke and can't pay for everyone's API usage), but you can join if you have the secret invite code.

1. **Go to [walletRIP.vercel.app](https://walletrip.vercel.app)**
2. **Click "Sign Up"**
3. **Choose a Callsign**: This is your unique username. Be creative.
4. **Set a Secret Code**: Must be at least 6 characters. Don't forget it; there is no "Forgot Password" link.
5. **Enter Invite Code**: You need the key `GEMINI2025` to enter.
6. **Start Tracking**: Type your expenses and let the judgment begin.

*Want to run your own instance? Follow the setup guide below.*
