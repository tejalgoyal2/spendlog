## 🧐 The Vibe
Most expense trackers are boring spreadsheets that feel like homework. **WalletRIP** is your wallet's conscience. It doesn't just track your spending; it judges it.

It’s built for speed, privacy, and brutal honesty.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 The AI Brain
Forget forms. Just type naturally: *"Spent 50 on pizza"* or *"Uber to work 25"*. The integrated AI parses the context, categorizes it, and logs it instantly. No local processing—everything happens in the cloud for maximum efficiency.

### ⚖️ The Sarcastic Judge
If you spend money on "Needs" (Rent, Groceries), it stays quiet. If you blow cash on "Wants" (Lego, overpriced coffee), it delivers a sarcastic reality check. It keeps you humble.

### 🔧 Under the Hood: The Engineering
We don't just ask Gemini to "read this." We feed it a strict system prompt that enforces:
1.  **JSON Schema Validation**: Ensures data is always clean for the database (no more "misc" categories).
2.  **Context Injection**: The AI is told it's a "Sarcastic Canadian Accountant." It knows 50 CAD is a normal lunch but 500 CAD is a crime.
3.  **Creative Temperature**: We dial up the creativity for the `funny_comment` field while keeping the `amount` and `date` fields strictly deterministic.

### 👻 Ghost Protocol Auth
Privacy is paramount.
- **No Email Required**: We don't want your spam address.
- **No Phone Numbers**: We don't want to text you.
- **Callsign Access**: Just pick a unique **Callsign** (username) and a **Secret Code**.
- **Universal Sync**: Access your data securely from any device—Mobile, Tablet, or Desktop.

### 🛡️ Military-Grade Security
Built on **Supabase** with strict **Row Level Security (RLS)**. Your financial data is isolated, encrypted, and visible *only* to you.

### 🎯 Zero-Hallucination Mode
The AI is trained to *never guess prices*. If you say "I want a PS5", it won't log $500 automatically; it asks you for the price.

### � Install on Mobile (PWA)
WalletRIP works best as a native app on your phone.
- **iOS (iPhone)**: Open Safari -> Tap Share -> Tap "Add to Home Screen".
- **Android**: Open Chrome -> Tap Menu (3 dots) -> Tap "Install App".
